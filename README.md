# Internet Shop Management System üåê  
**Final Project ‚Äì Database Management System (IS210)**

## Overview

This project is a **web-based management system for an internet caf√©**, built to streamline daily operations such as user access, billing, product tracking, and employee management. It was developed as a final project for the IS210 course at the University of Information Technology ‚Äì VNUHCM.

The system utilizes a combination of:
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- **Backend**: PHP
- **Database**: Oracle SQL

---

##  Features

### Admin Features
- Add/edit/delete computers, users, employees, and products
- Create and update invoices automatically based on purchases
- Recharge user accounts (even during active sessions)
- Track usage and remaining credit
- Ensure **1 user per machine** and **1 machine per user**
- Calculate session time based on remaining balance
- Update balance upon session completion

### User Features
- Login with account credentials
- View and manage remaining balance
- Use services based on real-time credit countdown

---

## System Architecture

- **Database**: Oracle SQL
- **Website Backend**: PHP with OCI8 connection to Oracle DB
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap for responsive UI, JavaScript for interactivity

### Key Components:
- `TAIKHOAN`: user accounts
- `MAYTINH`: computers
- `SUDUNG`: session usage tracking
- `SANPHAM`: available products
- `HOADON`, `CTHD`: invoices and details
- `NHANVIEN`: employee management

---

## Implementation Details

### Login System
- Users can log in only if they have more than 1 minute of available time.
- Enforced using **PL/SQL triggers** and validation logic.

### Credit Tracking
- Admin can recharge accounts, which immediately updates session time.
- After session ends, remaining time and credit are recalculated automatically.

### Invoice Management
- Invoices and their values are updated dynamically.
- Uses `PROCEDURE` to auto-generate invoice IDs and compute totals.

### Other Logic & Constraints
- Ensures unique mapping between computers and accounts during a session.
- Uses **triggers** and **stored procedures** for business logic enforcement.
